# Universal Comments

Universal Comments is a browser extension that adds comments to just about any place on the internet.
It works by looking at the url you are browsing, and checking for any recent visits from any other users.

If no other user has ever visited the website before, then a new comment section is started! Congratulations, you're adding stuff to the internet! Revel in the power!!!

From here, any user can add a comment to the website.

No account is required, effectively making Universal Comment fully anonymous.

## Features

Universal Comments allows users to:

- Add a comment section to any website visited
- Reply to one or more comments
- Up-vote or down-vote one or more comments.

## Harm Prevention

Let face it. This is a cool idea, but it brings a lot of safety concerns, especially for users that are not as tech savvy on the internet.

To prevent harmful interactions between other users, Universal Comments does not allow sharing URLs, uploading images, or following other users.
Along with these restrictions, comments are filtered to remove any profanity, to provide a peaceful and relaxing place for users.


## How To Use

Run the following commands:

```bash
npm install

npm run start
```
